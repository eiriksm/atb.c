# atb.c
C API for ATB schedule

[![Test](https://github.com/eiriksm/atb.c/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eiriksm/atb.c/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## About 

This project aims to provide a model and data for embedding AtB schedule data in something like a device without internet connection. In other words, the header file will contain schedules I need at the time of writing.

The data is therefore obviously not realtime in any way. They are simply downloaded and converted from here: https://developer.entur.org/stops-and-timetable-data (the GTFS format specifically).
